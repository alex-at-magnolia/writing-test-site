= Work with extensions

Visual Studio Code lets you add extensions such as languages, debuggers, and tools on top of the out-of-the-box features. This section describes how to find and install a Visual Studio Code extension.

== Find an extension

To browse the extensions in Visual Studio Code:

. Click the _Extensions_ icon (image:extension_icon.png[alt=Extension,width=20,height=20,align="center"]) in the Activity Bar on the left side of Visual Studio Code or go to *View* > *Extensions* to bring up the _Extensions_ view.
+
This displays the list of extensions that are currently enabled, as well as extensions recommended for your installation.
. Choose one of the recommended extensions or use the search box to filter the list of available extensions to extensions whose title or metadata contain your search term. See <<Install an extension>> for an example on how to install the Docker extension.

== Install an extension

To install an extension:

. Browse for the required extension, as described in the <<Find an extension>> section above.
. Click *Install*.
+
Wait until Visual Studio Code downloads and installs the extension from the Marketplace.
+
When the installation is complete, the *Install* button is replaced with a *Manage* gear button (image:manage_icon.png[alt=Manage,width=20,height=20,align="center"]).

The procedure below shows how to install the Docker extension. This extension makes it easy to build, manage, and deploy containerized applications from Visual Studio Code. It also provides one-click debugging of `Node.js`, `Python`, and `.NET Core` inside a container.

. In the _Extensions_ view, type 'docker' in the search box to filter the Marketplace offerings to extensions with 'docker' in the title or metadata.

. Click *Install*, and wait for the Docker extension to be downloaded and installed.
