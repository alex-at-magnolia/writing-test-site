== Answer

Once an email has reached your Gmail inbox, you can forward it to another email address really quickly.

To do that, go inside the page of the email you want to forward, you need to click the three dots that are at the top right corner, next to star icon and reply icon:

After that, a new window will show up where you need to select the Forward item from the list of options:

After that, you are going to have a new email composition window showing right beneath the email, asking you to write the email address where we want to forward it to. You can also add a message that shows at the top of the forwared email. 

After you are done with specifying the receiver and the message that will show at the top of the forwarded email, you need to just click _Send_:
